## Facebook Movement Data - Storytelling with Data 

### Method

+ download the facebook data movement data 

+ filter to max two or three countries

+ obtain geospatial files if needed 

+ plot timeline with trend lines and annotation
+ plot map with colour on movement data 
+ capture using filters to pick up over time movement 

+ assemble into story 



### Tools 

Tableau + Python as needed 

### Introduction

There must have been times during the past year that you have felt like you were living in a dystopian novel or had accidentally auditioned for a surrealist play, where faceless government agencies and a giant spiky virus was making decisions about your personal/ professional life and your freedom of movement. 

It would be silly for us to complete a data analyst course in this year without giving some attention to covid-19 data, but we will approach it as analysts - start with raw data, then add in our emotions and personal experience to shape it into a data story. We are working with a database that facebook has gathered and shared for public non-commercial use - when you can, give some thought to the reliability and quality of the data source, and what portion of the population is going to be unavoidably excluded from this data. 

### Objectives and Deliverable

- produce a **data story** centred around changes observed in human movement under covid-19 restrictions in specific country(/ies) or Region(s). Ideally the story should have a time element (ie changes in movement over a timeline) and some comparisons - compare cities or countries' experience at respective dates.
-  take your audience on a journey through the arc of your data story - hint: think about who your story would be targeted at, in order to pitch the visuals, language, descriptions, and technical details appropriately. This [link](https://blog.reedsy.com/narrative-arc) is a good one to get you thinking as a storyteller about narrative structures, the story arc and the various elements of a plot eg inciting incident.

RAW DATA : We have one open data source to work with - other elements of the story can be drawn from our own experiences - ie key dates, policy changes


[movement-range-data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps)
This data source is kept monthly up to date, contains data on many (but not all countries) and some guidance on how to use it. You will also see some examples online of other designers and analysts making use of this data.

### Guidance / Tips 

- Always start with drafting a story on a whiteboard or paper - think about zooming in on the major story and identifying an interesting/ surprising focus point. Avoid the ones that we know well from the news. This is a bit like when a film has the major plot (eg. covid pandemic) and you also get a few side character plots (eg. whats happening in switzerland, or the region around Prague, during this time?)
